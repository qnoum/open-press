# Open Press [![Buy me a tree](https://img.shields.io/badge/Buy%20me%20a%20tree-%F0%9F%8C%B3-lightgreen)](https://offset.earth/adrian)

I created this addon to allow you to read articles from websites that implement easy paywalls to bypass.

Not everyone is able to afford multiple subscriptions on many different news websites, even less when they just want to read a single article without being enrolled in a montly/yearly membership.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è If you use this addon regularly on the same website, please consider paying a subscription for it. Don't forget that free press cannot be sunstainable without money.
